# Button Mash
This is a simple game that can be used for learning basic Godot or for playing it (but I don't know why you should play it).

The objective is to click **99999** times a button to then... reset... and again win and reset.

You can use it as an example of game for learning basic Godot.
The game was created with version `4.3.stable`.
